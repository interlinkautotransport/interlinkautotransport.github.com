		<p>The Ronald McDonald Family Room provides a haven of respite and hospitality to families whose children are in treatment at the hospital. Located just outside the pediatric intensive care unit and outpatient service area, the space provides a home-like atmosphere away from the stress of the hospital, allowing families a moment to rest and rejuvenate, so that they can face the stress of the hospital visit with renewed energy.</p>
