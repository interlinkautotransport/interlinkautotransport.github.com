Located just outside the pediatric intensive care unit and outpatient service area, the space provides a home-like atmosphere away from the stress of the hospital, allowing families a moment to rest and rejuvenate, so that they can face the stress of the hospital visit with renewed energy.</p>

	5 year-old Erin Grace is a special little girl. Erin has Down Syndrome and now is fighting leukemia. Erin was taken to the doctor on May 20, 2014 due to a rash. Her older sister had been sick the week before and Erin's parents, Brian and Diana, thought Erin might have caught the same bug. The doctor recognized the rash as a petechial rash, a condition in which blood leaks out of the skin's capillaries and causes small red dots on the skin. Erin's pediatrician ordered blood work which revealed that her platelet count was very low. She was immediately admitted into the hospital. The following day she had a bone marrow extraction and was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). 18 hours after being seen by her doctor for what her parents thought was just a viral rash, Erin received her first chemotherapy treatment. She has also received multiple platelet infusions as she is struggling to maintain her platelet count. Erin is facing 2 years of chemo and treatment.
</p>
<p>
	Team Erin is dedicated to providing support to the Grace family by organizing a variety of fundraisers to help them with medical and other expenses. If you would like to volunteer for a fundraiser, please send a private message to the Team Erin page.
